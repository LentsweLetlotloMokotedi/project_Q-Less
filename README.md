# project_Q-Less
Q-Less is a digital queue management system designed for South African clinics to reduce waiting times, improve patient flow, and provide real-time queue updates. Patients can book appointments remotely, receive notifications, and only arrive when itâ€™s their turn, saving time and reducing overcrowding.
